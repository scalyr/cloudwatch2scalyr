#  Streaming Logs from CloudWatch to Scalyr

In order to send logs to Scalyr in near-real-time, there are two steps involved:

1. Create an AWS Lambda Function that receives CloudWatch log events, transforms them to a Scalyr-compatible message, and posts that to a Scalyr API.
2. Set up your CloudWatch Log Group(s) with a subscription filter that will stream CloudWatch log data to that Lambda function.

If you haven’t set up a "cloudwatch2scalyr" Lambda function yet, both of these steps will be taken care of in the steps as described below.

**NOTE:** At some point (later in the instructions) you'll be asked to upload a ZIP file to Amazon. You can find the latest pre-built copy [here](https://github.com/scalyr/cloudwatch2scalyr/blob/master/dist/cloudwatch2scalyr.zip), or you can build your own locally using the make_distribution.sh shell script.

## Start the Lambda Function creation wizard

First, go to the Lambda Management Console in AWS. For us-east-1, the link is [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions?display=list](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions?display=list) – if you’re in a different region, you can substitute that region for "us-east-1" in the URL above.

Depending on whether you have other Lambda functions, you'll see a "Create a function" or "Create function" button. Click on it.

Click the "Author from scratch" button on the page that appears.

## Create the function

On the next page, you’ll need to specify a function name, as well as define a Lambda execution role, if it does not exist already.

First, specify the function name. In this example we're using "cloudwatch2scalyr."

Define a role for your function. Below the function name that you specified, choose "Create new role from template(s)" from the Role dropdown, give the role a name, and choose “KMS decryption permissions” from the Policy Templates dropdown:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_1.png" width="800"></div>
<br>

When you are done, click on "Create function."

## Specify function configuration

On the next page, you'll need to specify all configuration for your function, including uploading the function code, which is in cloudwatch2scalyr.zip.

First, you'll need to upload your function. Select "Upload a .ZIP file" from the Code entry type dropdown, and upload cloudwatch2scalyr.zip. Then select "Node.js 4.3" from the Runtime dropdown.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_2.png" width="900"></div>
<br>

Next, click the triangle next to "Environment variables" to expand the "Environment variables" section. You’ll need to specify your Scalyr "Write Logs" API key as an environment variable. In order to do this, you’ll need to create a KMS encryption key if you don’t have one in your account already (beyond the scope of this document). Enable the "Enable helpers for encryption in transit" checkbox, then select your encryption key under "KMS key to encrypt in transit" and "KMS key to encrypt at rest."

Specify your API key by doing the following:

* Enter "SCALYR_WRITE_LOGS_KEY" in the first column (no quotes)
* Provide your account’s actual Scalyr "Write Logs" API Key in the second column.
* Click "Encrypt".

Once you’ve done this, you should see something like:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_3.png" width="900"></div>

There are additional environment variables you can pass to the code - `USE_ADD_EVENTS_API`, `PARSER_NAME`, and `SCALYR_BASE_URL`. (These should not be encrypted.)
* In general, `USE_ADD_EVENTS_API` should be false (and you don’t actually need to specify it unless you want it to be true).
* `PARSER_NAME` is optional as well and refers to a specific custom parser defined using the Scalyr UI - if not specified, the default parser is used.
* `SCALYR_BASE_URL` defaults to `https://www.scalyr.com` and selects the Scalyr region to which you want to upload your logs. Currently, the only valid values are `https://www.scalyr.com` and `https://upload.eu.scalyr.com`.  *Note:* If this parameter is configured incorrectly, you will not get error messages from Scalyr during log upload; AWS logs of this Lambda function will look as if everything is working, but the logs won't be displayed in Scalyr.

## Save and test the function

After you've entered all necessary information, you can save and test the function. Click on the "Save and test" button in the upper right-hand corner. On the screen that appears, ensure that "Create new test event" is selected, then select "CloudWatch Logs" from the Event template dropdown. Give the event a name, then click "Create" at the bottom of the page.

Next, click on "Test" in the upper-right corner of the page. If the results state "Execution result: succeeded," go to the Log View in Scalyr and look for "cloudwatch-<aws_account_id>" and click on the function name next to it.

You should then see CloudWatch logs like these:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_5.png" width="900"></div>
<br>

Note: If you want to change the values of the parser, log group name, or server name see the information about LOG_GROUP_OPTIONS below.

## Configure trigger

On the next page, you’ll configure a trigger to invoke the function. Click on the rounded dashed-line rectangle to do this and then select "CloudWatch Logs" from the dropdown that appears:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_6.png" width="200"></div>
<br>

At this point, you’ll need to select a Log Group and provide a Filter Name (which can be anything, but it is required). Also, check the "Enable trigger" checkbox:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="markdown_images/image_7.png" width="800"></div>
<br>

## A bit about the addEvents transformation code (experimental)

This is an **experimental** feature that allows you to do some parsing in AWS Lambda itself by modifying the code in cloudwatch2scalyr.
You can also customize the `serverHost`, `logfile`, and `parser` on a per-log-group basis by setting an environment variable, `LOG_GROUP_OPTIONS`.

The cloudwatch2scalyr.zip file contains one main file (index.js) as well as supporting Node.js libraries. If you wish to pre-parse interesting fields from the logs, you’ll probably be most interested in the *transformToAddEventsMessage* function, which is responsible for translating from CloudWatch-speak to Scalyr-speak. **Note: at this time, we don’t recommend using the addEvents API from Amazon Lambda (use uploadLogs, the default, instead).**

To use `LOG_GROUP_OPTIONS`, set the variable to a JSON string with log group names as keys, e.g.:

```javascript
{
  "API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_abcdef12345/production": {
    "serverHost": "API-Gateway",
    "logfile": "My-Friendly-Api-Name",
    "parser": "myGatewayParser"
  },
  "API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_12345abcdef/production": {
    "serverHost": "API-Gateway",
    "logfile": "My-Other-Api"
  }
}
```

Defaults are used for any omitted fields.

For more information about the format Scalyr expects, see this link: [https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#addEvents](https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#addEvents)

The function can be found [here](src/index.js#L43).
